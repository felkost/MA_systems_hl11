"""Filesystem locations, anchored to the checkout rather than to the caller.

`Settings` stores its paths as relative strings (`data`, `index`,
`.cache/models`) so that no machine-specific path reaches `.env`. Resolving
them here means `python ingest.py` writes the same index from any working
directory, and the model cache stays inside the checkout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str or Path
